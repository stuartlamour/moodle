This file describes API changes in /theme/boost
information provided here is intended especially for theme designers.

=== 3.5 ===
* this version uses Boostrap 4 stable and contains a number of new ways to use components see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components.
* for more info on all of the changes since 4 - alpha please read https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/migration/
* Uses a new Grid system based on Flexbox. Reading up on the new Grid system is a must when creating new grid based layouts in child themes.

Sass
----
* A number of variables are no longer available in Bootstrap 4 Stable. For now a bs4alpha compatibility file has been added, see scss/bs4alphacompat.scss which translates veriable names from the Alpha version to the stable version
* col-xs-* should be replaced with col-*
* m-t-* and other spacing utilities should be replaced with mt-* ["|\s]m-[t|b|l|r]

Templates
---------
All instances of col-xs-12 have been replaces with col-12
Cards need this structure
 class='card'
    class='card-body'
This used to be 'card-block'

The header.mustache template has been replace by a navbar.mustache template for name consistancy with Bootstrap

A new header.mustache template has been created served from core/core_renderer.php. This should be move to core at some point.


=== 3.4 ===
* For improved accessibility, the footer links for boost have been changed to use $bg-inverse-link-color (defaults to white) and
  now have an underline text-decoration. To override the link colour simply set $bg-inverse-link-color in your preset file or
  theme scss.
* To match the new primary colour we are switching to using the UX pallette, which uses a purple colour for info. To override,
  set $brand-info in your preset file or theme scss.
